# anomaly-dependencies-project
A curated list of common modding dependencies to be downloaded by the Anomaly Mod Configuration Menu

## Guidelines
* Names of dependancies and thier componant files should be self descriptive.
* Dependency scripts should be self documented.
* Dependencies built on monkey patches should be as targeted as posible (rax_icon_layers and rax_persistant_highlights should be seperate dependencies not grouped into rax_inventory_tools).
* Dependencies should be substantualy unique. 
* Dependencies included here should not interfere with one another.
